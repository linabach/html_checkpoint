        <h4>Before we start coding with Html we should first notice the differences between Presentaion and structure of the website</h4>

        <h3>*Presentaion:</h3>
        <p> Presentation (or Style) refers to anything related to how the content and structure is presented. Examples: size, color, margins, borders, layout, location, etc. which is css's role</p>
        <h3>**Structure:</h3>
        <p>Structure refers to the practice of using HTML on content to convey meaning (semantics) and to describe how blocks of information are structured to one another. Examples: "this is a list" (ol, ul, li)</p>

        <h3>3-Common Htmls terms:</h3>
        <h4>*Elements:</h4>
        <p>Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page.
        Some of the more frequently used elements include multiple levels of headings  and paragraphs  the list goes on ... Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, surrounding the element name. Thus, an element will look like the following:</p>
        <hr>
        <img src="Capture.PNG" alt="html" width="50%" height="50%">
        <hr>
        <h4>**Tags:</h4>
        <p> The use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets surrounding an element creates what is known as a tag. Tags most commonly occur in pairs of opening and closing tags.
            An opening tag marks the beginning of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by an element's name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example.
            A closing tag marks the end of an element. It consists of a less-than sign followed by a forward slash and the element's name, and then ends with a greater-than sign; for example.
            The content that falls between the opening and closing tags is the content of that element. What falls between these two tags will be the content of the anchor link.
            So, anchor tags will look a bit like this:</p>
        <hr>
            <img   src="Capture 2.PNG" alt="html" width="35%" height="35%">
        <hr>
        <h4>***Attributes:</h4>
        <p> Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.
            Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an elementâ€™s name. Generally attributes include a name and a value. The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted attribute value. For example, this element including an href attribute would look like the following:</p>
        <hr>
            <img src="Capture 3.PNG" alt="html" width="50%" height="50%">
        <hr>
        <img src="Capture 4.PNG" alt="html" width="50%" height="50%">
        <hr>
        <label  for="file">Course Progress:</label>
        <progress  id="file" value="30" max="100"> 30% </progress> 
        <hr>
        <h3>Now that you know what HTML elements, tags, and attributes are, let's take a look at putting together our first web page. If anything looks new here, no worries we'll decipher it as we go.</h3>
        <p>HTML documents are plain text documents saved with an .html file extension rather than a .txt file extension. To begin writing HTML, you first need a plain text editor that you are comfortable using</p>
        <p>All HTML documents have a required structure that includes the following declaration and elements:</p>
        <img src="Capture5.PNG" alt="Workplace" usemap="#workmap" width="50%" height="50%">
